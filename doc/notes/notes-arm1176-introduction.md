#### 1.1 About the processor

Note that the difference between the JZ-S and the JZF-S is solely the VFP coprocessor.

#### 1.2 Extensions to ARMv6

ARM1176JZF-S has:
- `strex/ldrex` for `b,h,d`, and a new Clear Exclusive instruction
- true `nop` and `yield`
- "architectural remap registers"
- cache size restriction (CP15 c1)
- revised use of TEX remap bits (seems to help simplify the page table descriptors?)
- revised use of AP bits: `APX` and `AP[1:0]` encoding `b111` is Privileged or User mode read only accessâ€”`AP[0]` indicates an abort type, Access Bit fault, when `CP15 c1[29]` is 1 (???)

#### 1.3 TrustZone security extensions

(not yet of interest)

#### 1.4 ARM1176JZF-S architecture with Jazelle technology

(not interested)

#### 1.5 Components of the processor

There are 15 processing modes:
- User
- Supervisor
- FIQ (fast interrupt)
- IRQ (normal interrupt)
- abort
- system
- undefined
- secure monitor
The first 7 have both Secure or Non Secure world modes.
